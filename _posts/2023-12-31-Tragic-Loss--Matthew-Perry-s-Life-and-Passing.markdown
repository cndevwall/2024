### Breakout Role on Friends 

In 1994, Perry landed the role of Chandler Bing on the hit sitcom Friends. The show was an instant success and made Perry a household name and major celebrity. Though thrilled by his newfound fame, Perry was also struggling mightily with addiction behind the scenes. He would sometimes show up drunk or high to film Friends. His co-stars noticed his issues but the show must go on.

### Perry's Addiction Battles

In 1997, Perry was in a jet-skiing accident that resulted in gastrointestinal perforations. He became dependent on the painkillers he was prescribed. This marked the start of Perry's vicious cycle with substance abuse. Over the next decade, Perry entered rehab numerous times and underwent countless detoxes to get sober. However, none seemed to fully cure his addiction demons for long. His attempts at sobriety were also complicated by untreated depression and anxiety. 

### Health Problems Escalate

In 2018, Perry's intestinal issues had become life threatening. His colon spontaneously ruptured and he fell into a coma for two weeks. After waking up, Perry told friends he felt lucky to survive. However, his remaining health was now permanently impacted. Several more abdominal surgeries were needed. Perry indicated many of his health woes stemmed from years of substance abuse taking a toll.

### Struggles on Friends

It's now known that Perry does not remember filming three years' worth of Friends due to his active addiction. Under the influence, he struggled greatly with memorizing lines. This caused major stress on set. His co-stars cared deeply for him but the emotional turmoil also impacted friendships. Rewatching old episodes is a sad reminder of the personal hell Perry was living through at the time.

### Reaction to Perry's Passing 

In 2022, the world was shocked to hear of Matthew Perry's death at age 53. Friends co-stars Jennifer Aniston and Courteney Cox expressed their grief on social media. Fans flooded twitter with appreciation for the character of Chandler Bing. Though his struggle was long, Perry impacted countless lives through the laughs he brought on Friends for so many years. He will be deeply missed by fans worldwide. 

### Autopsy Results

The coroner's report found that Perry had passed due to "acute intestinal perforation with subsequent sepsis." Ketamine was also found in his system. This contributed to the perforation and his already compromised digestive system could not recover. It served as a tragic reminder of how the cumulative effects of addiction can damage one's health long after.
