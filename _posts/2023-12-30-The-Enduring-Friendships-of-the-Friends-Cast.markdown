### Jennifer Aniston and Matthew Perry's Bond
Jennifer Aniston and Matthew Perry developed a close friendship over the 10 seasons they spent together on the hit sitcom Friends. While their characters Rachel Green and Chandler Bing started out as uneasy acquaintances, Perry revealed in his recent memoir that he initially had a crush on his co-star Aniston. However, any romantic feelings soon gave way to a caring friendship as they got to know each other better through working together every day on set. 

Aniston would become one of Perry's closest confidants, especially as he privately battled substance abuse issues during his time on Friends. She supported him through some extremely difficult periods as his addiction took its toll both physically and mentally. Even over 20 years later, their bond remains strong as evidenced by Aniston's emotional tribute to Perry at the Friends reunion special, where she spoke of looking up to him "like a little brother."

### Matthew Perry and Matt LeBlanc's Connection
While Friendscame to an end in 2004 after its tenth season, Perry and LeBlanc have continued to stay in touch. They frequently praise each other during joint interviews, with Perry calling LeBlanc a "buddy" he cares deeply about. LeBlanc has also referred to having a "great relationship" with Perry that has lasted well beyond their time as co-stars on the iconic sitcom. Both actors seem to have formed an enduring off-screen friendship thanks to the close bonds developed over many years of working together.

### Aniston and Perry's Relationship in Perspective 
Aniston’s heartfelt words about Perry at the Friends reunion spoke volumes about the admiration and caring she still feels for her former co-star, even two decades later. In his memoir, Perry also reflected fondly on the emotional support Aniston provided him privately during his toughest battles with addiction issues while filming the show. Their relationship shows how meaningful connections can form between cast members through sharing the highly intimate experience of making a popular TV series together for years.

### Matt LeBlanc's Career Post-Friends
While the Friends spinoff Joey focused on Matt LeBlanc's character Joey Tribbiani failed to catch on, LeBlanc found new success in recent decades. He starred in several movies after Friends wrapped up but truly regained fame and acclaim through his starring role in the Showtime series Episodes from 2011 to 2017. LeBlanc also led the popular CBS sitcom Man With A Plan for four seasons from 2016 to 2020, demonstrating his enduring talents long after Friends left the air.

### Matthew Perry's Health Over the Years
Friends fans noticed Matthew Perry's appearance fluctuate noticeably over the show's 10 season run, changes many attributed even at the time to substance abuse issues. Perry would later be open about his past struggles with addiction to drugs and alcohol taking a heavy toll on his physical and mental wellbeing. While clearly affected for many years, more recently Perry seems happier and healthier than during some of his darker periods in the late 90s/early 2000s. His new memoir provides insight into the challenges and progress he's made on his personal journey to wellness since those days.

### Matthew Perry and Jennifer Aniston's Romantic History  
In addition to their strong friendship bond, Perry revealed in his memoir that he initially found Jennifer Aniston hugely attractive when they first met. He asked her out early on but was turned down. However, rather than make things awkward, they maintained a professional working relationship that soon blossomed into a caring friendship off-screen as well. Their compatibility as friends endured far longer than any brief romantic intrigue when they were first getting to know each other as the actors cast to play Rachel and Chandler.

### The Friends Reunion Special in 2021
Seventeen years after Friends finished its epic 10 season run, the long-awaited reunion special brought the beloved cast back together. Viewers were delighted to see Aniston, Perry, LeBlanc, Courteney Cox, Lisa Kudrow and David Schwimmer reminiscing together on the iconic Friends sets. The special highlighted not only their joint success but the clearly enduring bonds between them, including Aniston and Perry's close relationship that has continued growing long after the cameras stopped rolling.

### Russ vs Ross from Friends
While they shared the last name, Russ and Ross Geller were very different characters. Russ was a brief flame of Rachel's, a dentist she dated for a few episodes in Season 2. Played by David Schwimmer in a minor guest role, Russ never made much of an impression. However, viewers will always remember Schwimmer's career-defining leading role as paleontologist Ross Geller, one of the six central friends at the heart of the show throughout its entire 10 season run.

### No Proof Matthew Perry and Luke Perry Were Related
There was never any actual evidence or documentation linking the two American actors Matthew Perry and Luke Perry by blood or family relations. Both rose to fame in the 1990s-early 2000s in prominent TV roles, he for Beverly Hills 90210 and she for Friends, leading some casual fans to wonder if they may be cousins or another type of relation due to their shared last name. However, the Perrys came from independent lineages and were not proven to have any genetic connection despite their similar surnames.
